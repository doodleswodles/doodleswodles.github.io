            &nbsp; &nbsp; pov: Benny "Bernard" Guinevere
            <br />
            <br />
            Benny's most beloved thing in the world was his Journal. He spent years writing anything he could find at the castle library about magic. It is his prize and his parents hate it. They rather he focus on his statecraft studies. For years they have tried to *persuade* him, to little effect, but they can't really *stop* him. Because one of the first things that Benny learned was how hide the journal.&nbsp;
            <br />
            <br />
            But Benny's negligence of his duties as a Lord can't get him out of this.&nbsp;
            <br />
            <br />
            Benny wakes up in his tower study, Lacy's vicious knocking startling him. He scrambles from his desk and rushes down the steps of the tower, the arrowslits casting warm morning sun on his pale strawberry hair. Entering his room he comes to find Lacy leaning at his door, tray on hand. Benny winces as he sits down at his table, he had missed breakfast.&nbsp;
            <br />
            <br />
            "Lord Bernard, I cannot believe you missed breakfast. On such a day too." Lacy said, putting down the tray, containing a couple slices of soaked toast and fresh juice. "Your father wanted to speak of tomorrow's guests with you."
            <br />
            <br />
            Benny sighs as he picks up one of the slices. "I didn't mean to fall asleep in the study. I got carried away yesterday night."&nbsp;
            <br />
            <br />
            "Well. Apparently it's important cause he wants you in his study once you're finished here." Lucy says leaving a note by the tray. "Good luck."
            <br />
            <br />
            Benny grimaces as she leaves the room. He takes his damn time finishing his meal, not looking forward to the lecture and likely nagging he is about to receive. Taking this time to finish another chapter of reading in one of the few non academic books he choses to read. But inevitably, when the last crumb of toast is eaten, and the last drop of juice is drank; he gets up from his chair and leaves for the study.&nbsp;
            <br />
            <br />
            The castle is positively bustling with activity, even the relatively quiet 3rd floor hums with the sounds of the servants preparing things below. Although things do get quieter as he walks up the main staircase. He reaches the 4th floor, dragging his feet he walks left to the doors of the study and knocks.&nbsp;
            <br />
            <br />
            "Come in." His father responds.
            <br />
            <br />
            Sighing he opens the door. "You wanted to speak with me father?"
            <br />
            <br />
            "Yes, I was going to talk to all of you about this at breakfast, but I suppose you knowing first wouldn't hurt." Strange, his father never *needed* him to be present to talk important matters.&nbsp;
            <br />
            <br />
            "What do you mean father?" He cautiously ask.
            <br />
            <br />
            "Tomorrow's guests are the Earl and Lady of Bleakward, they and their family will be staying here a week because the Earl and I are in talks," Bernard's father pauses as if to brace himself for the next few words, little did he know what those words would lead to.&nbsp;
            <br />
            <br />
            "To arrange your marriage to their younger daughter."
            <br />
            <br />
            And just like that it was like the fantasy of freedom he'd been led believe he had crumbles between his fingers.&nbsp;
            <br />
            <br />
            "Now I know you have only just turned of age, but Lady Montague's family assured you two will have a year's courting period, for she recently turned 18 as well."
            <br />
            <br />
            "Father, I told you I intended to study at the capitol's university! Why spring this on me with no warning!" Bernard pleads for his case knowing this is in vain. "Why send me off to the southern coast on an arranged marriage!"
            <br />
            <br />
            "Bernard. I told you to drop the topic of university. Sorcery is below a Lord, you need not bother yourself with the labor of it."&nbsp; The Duke speaks stern. "And I'll let you know Bleakward university has a very nice Statesmanship course."
            <br />
            <br />
            "You keep trying to make me into something I am not!"
            <br />
            <br />
            "Enough of your childishness. I cannot let you be buried in books anymore. You will attend dinner with us Tomorrow and own up to your responsibilities as the Lord son Guinevere."
            <br />
            <br />
            Benny storms out of the room and down the staircase. He can't believe the gull of his father to arrange a marriage for him. He thought as a third born son he would at least get a chance to mill around and maybe choose who to court. But it seems his father was intent of sending him off to the coast on a political marriage. He crosses the Ballroom in a fury out of the back garden's doors and around the back of the kitchens to sulk.&nbsp;
            <br />
            <br />
            Benny crouches against the castle walls, drawing his knees up. He was sure the girl was lovely in her own right, but he frankly had no interest in women. Not that his father knew this, but still he might have gone along with this if just she wasn't a lady. Hell for all he knew Bleakward had a decent Sorcerer school, it's a port city its highly likely. But frankly he was using his love of magic to cover for the not liking ladies thing.&nbsp;
            <br />
            <br />
            And he was not sure how much longer he could keep that up.&nbsp;
            <br />
            <br />
            Benny sighs, lowering his head on his knees. If only he could just, run away to Heliados.
            <br />
            <br />
            *'crash'*
            <br />
            <br />
            Benny's head shoots up and he sees a large black wolf leap over the hedges and onto the greater grounds. Behind him a gaggle of cooks and servants scream 'Thief!' but they fail to leave the kitchens fast enough to catch the wolf before it disappears behind the hedges onto the gardens, someone yells for them to just leave the guards to it, and they rush back in. Benny's mild shock to the quick series of event quickly dissipates and he chuckles a bit.&nbsp;
            <br />
            <br />
            Although something about that wolf seemed off. Wolves don't tend to appear inside kitchens out of thin air. No, something was up. Benny decides he firmly does not want to get back in there and decides to head where the 'wolf' ran.&nbsp;
            <br />
            <br />
            He enters the gardens, careful to keep hidden as best as he can, and heads towards the north wall at the riverbank. Benny, walks almost the entire gardens until he spots a moving shade at the edge of the small hill where they keep a forested grove for keeping game. Gotcha.&nbsp;
            <br />
            <br />
            He approaches the shaded area hiding behind a tree to scope the place out. His guess was right on the money, as a little further away a 'wolf' holding a loaf of bread looked around for any onlookers before shifting back into a human form. The 'wolf' now resembled a young-ish boy, if Benny had to guess he was around his age, of very light complexion, he had curly night black hair that shaggily draped around his head, his bangs covered his eyes but Benny could see the faint reflection of blood red. The 'wolf' proceeded to scarf down the loaf, and Benny could not blame him. He was thin, and by the way he was inhaling the bread this was probably his first meal in a while.&nbsp;
            <br />
            <br />
            Benny waited until he was done before approaching him cautiously.
            <br />
            <br />
            "You seem like you needed that." He tried.&nbsp;
            <br />
            <br />
            The 'wolf' startled and reached for what he assumed was a weapon. Shit. "Whoa no need for that I'm not going to tell on you."
            <br />
            <br />
            He seemed to unclench at that but his hand did not move. "Like I said it seems like you needed it, wolf boy."
            <br />
            <br />
            "I did." He responds.&nbsp;
            <br />
            <br />
            Benny sits down on the log of a old fallen tree. "What's your name?"
            <br />
            <br />
            "What's it to you."&nbsp;
            <br />
            <br />
            "It's polite to ask. How did you do that?"
            <br />
            <br />
            "Do what?"
            <br />
            <br />
            "The wolf thing?"
            <br />
            <br />
            "I'm a Therian, I thought that was obvious."
            <br />
            <br />
            "Oh, i have never heard of that, although i suppose the castle library is a little limited on this kind of stuff."
            <br />
            <br />
            "How did you get to the library? That's on the second floor?"
            <br />
            <br />
            "I'm the duke's son. Bernard Guinevere, but please never call me that. Call me Benny."
            <br />
            <br />
            "Why did you track me here then? If you aren't reporting me." The boy asks in annoyance.
            <br />
            <br />
            Benny grimaces. "I don't want to be *in there* right now."
            <br />
            <br />
            "Why?" He relaxes a bit, leaning back on his hands.
            <br />
            <br />
            "I'm to be betrothed, tomorrow i get to meet my wonderful future fianc&eacute;" Benny tries to muster the tone his mother uses towards the end there.&nbsp;
            <br />
            <br />
            The boy laughs. "And what? She not nerd enough for you?"
            <br />
            <br />
            Benny smiles as he lets a secret not even his brothers know easily slip his tongue. "More like 'she' is not enough 'he' for me"
            <br />
            <br />
            That send the boy into a fit, falling onto the mossy floor below him. Benny laughs along, and for a moment the dread of it escapes him. The guy eventually composes him self into asking.
            <br />
            <br />
            "Why are you telling me this? Aren't you afraid I'll tell on you?"
            <br />
            <br />
            "Oh please like the city already doesn't have a dozen rumors of me." Benny groans. "For a solid YEAR half the place thought I was secretly courting a sorcerer traveler because I kept sneaking to the market to hear her talks on using common weeds in plant manipulation instead of seeds."
            <br />
            <br />
            "You're very interesting Oh Lord of Books Benny, but i can't linger too long. After all your guards are not as benevolent as you." He pulls up his hood and gets up. "I would say se ya later, but I'm not staying here for much longer." He comes closer, gently pulling benny's hand to his lips. "Farewell, it was a pleasure."
            <br />
            <br />
            Benny flusters, and The Boy turns away with a smirk. "Miles." He says.
            <br />
            <br />
            "What?" Benny stammers.
            <br />
            <br />
            "My name, it's Miles."
            <br />
            <br />
            With that Miles shifts back into a wolf and leaves. Leaving Benny flustered, a little confused but in slightly higher spirits. And possibly, with an idea.
            <br />
            <br />
            ___
            <br />
            <br />
            The sun sets behind the castle walls, Benny has almost gathered everything he needs. He double checks his satchel, he had cast everything he could in the number of containment tins he made before. House Tent, Cook Set, A bag full of his more common looking clothes, As many books he could fit in a potato bag he looted from the kitchens, First aid kit, and as much non perishable food he could find. The tins took up most of the space in the satchel but there was also room for his coin bag, maps and compass. He had sent a letter ahead to a pen pal of his telling him he might need to crash there for a couple nights.&nbsp;
            <br />
            <br />
            This was it huh, he doubted he would see this place again if it all went well but it still felt weird to leave. He wrote a letter addressing his mother and father, telling them he couldn't go through with this and had to leave. Benny dropped the letter at his table and quietly left his room. He quickly rounded the corner to the servant's stairway, stepping down the narrow steps under the cover of moonlight.&nbsp;
            <br />
            <br />
            Benny opened the door to the outside and breathed for what felt like the first time in forever. The fullest moon he could have wished for lights his way to freedom. Benny knew how to leave undetected, after all how could he actually practice his spellwork if the castle grounds keeper kept telling on him for 'Disturbing his work.' on the inside of the walls was a few ladders for quick access and at night those were hardly guarded. He just had to time this right, as one of the guards patrolling was passing behind the ladder, Benny started the climb under the cover of the trees. He quickly climbed up but didn't hop onto the walls just yet. He reached for the bundle of rope tied to the bottom of the satchel, preparing to do this as fast as he could.&nbsp;
            <br />
            <br />
            When he saw the guard had finished going up one of the corner tower's steps Benny scrambled up and over to the other side. Looping the rope twice around the metal light post at the top, he held the doubled rope, praying that the leather gloves would lessen the burn and slid down the wall. He not so gently dropped on the grassy hill the castle stood on but nevertheless, he did it! He pulled one side of the rope letting it untangle and fall to a puddle beside him. He gathered it as best he could before ducking into the alleyways.
