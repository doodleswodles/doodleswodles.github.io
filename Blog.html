    <h1>First Blog Post!!</h1>
    <p>Hey!!! <br>
    This is my first time actually trying to make a blog I update. I am mainly going to use this for my game dev escapades but may pepper in other aspects.<br>
    Today i basically did fucketh all in terms of making a game because i was coding this blog lol. But i did learn an animation trick for a tiny game i plan on making beside my B I G project X3c</p>
    
    <p>Can't give any saucy details on that one yet but it IS in the first stages of planning.</p>
    
    <p>The tiny game though I plan to be a small zelda-like top down. Not too big, like 30 min playtime kinda thing. Its gonna be free, with an option to tip the bellhop if you want.</p>
    
    <p>This is all I have for now! Have a nice day wherever you are and keep creating!</p>

    <h1>Progress Report</h1>
    <p>Hey!!!</p>

    <p>It's been a bit since my last update here but here's whats uppppp.</p>
    
    <p>Progress on my main project has been goin steady despite M A N Y annoying unforeseen occurrences. <br>
    Most of the plot is sketched out, like the main areas and story beats. I already have summaries for the first two chapters and a bit of level design done as well. Coding the main battle system is going to take a bit to do (mostly because it is slightly above my skill level but i am managing fine) so i am coding the main game in parallel to it.</p>
    
    <p>Music is coming along awesome! i have a couple concepts done and the ppl who listened rly liked them.</p>
    
    <p>Hope to update more but we will see how stuff goessssss.</p>
    
    <p>Have a lovely day,</p>
